** building for debian
*** tying debbuild
   - fedora uses /usr/libexec/git-core/, while debian uses /usr/lib/git-core/
   - fedora uses /usr/lib/python3.X/site-packages, while debian uses /usr/lib/python3.X/dist-packages

   - where should the git helpers actually go? where does git actually look for helpers?
     - ?? /usr/share/git-core ???

   - where should the python code go? where does python actually look for packages?
     - ??? /usr/local/lib/pythonX.X ???

** running in dom0
   # FIXME: What if we are running from dom0?
   # mylostone/git-remote-qubes.git/src/gitremotequbes/client.py:40
   # vm = subprocess.Popen(
   #   ["/usr/lib/qubes/qrexec-client-vm"
   - I used some code snippets from the qubes qrexec client from
     dom0(/fedora-vm?) /usr/lib/python3.8/site-packages/qrexec/client.py for
     RPC_MULTIPLEXER and such
